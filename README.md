pdfUnion
========

A small tool to merge two pdf files into one.
This project consists of two parts.
One is in GUI and another in CLI.

I have used pdfbox library of apache.

To compile in terminal type :

javac -cp pdfbox-app-1.8.4.jar test.java

and to run type
java -cp .:pdfbox-app-1.8.4.jar test pdf1.pdf pdf2.pdf
pdf1.pdf and pdf2.pdf are two input files as arguments.
